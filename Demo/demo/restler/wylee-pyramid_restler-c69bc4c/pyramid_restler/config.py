    URL patterns for an entity are mapped to a set of views encapsulated in
    a view class. The view class interacts with the model through a context
    adapter that knows the particulars of that model.

    To use this directive in your application, first call
    `config.include('pyramid_restler')` somewhere in your application's
    `main` function, then call `config.add_restful_routes(...)`.

    ``name`` is used as the base name for all route names and patterns. In
    route names, it will be used as-is. In route patterns, underscores will
    be converted to dashes.

    ``factory`` is the model adapter that the view interacts with. It can be
    any class that implements the :class:`pyramid_restler.interfaces.IContext`
    interface.

    ``view`` must be a view class that implements the
    :class:`pyramid_restler.interfaces.IView` interface.

    Additional route and view keyword args can be passed directly through to
    all `add_route` and `add_view` calls. Pass ``route_kw`` and/or ``view_kw``
    as dictionaries to do so.
